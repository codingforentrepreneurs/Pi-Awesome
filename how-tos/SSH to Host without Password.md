# SSH without password each time
This is a quick reference on how to ssh into a host server without using a password. It's all done through using `public` keys generated by `ssh-keygen` 

### 1. Create Public Key
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

### 2. Copy public key to host (automatically)
> Windows users must use step 
```
REMOTE_HOST=pi@raspberrypi
ssh-copy-id $REMOTE_HOST
```

### 3. Copy public key to host (manully)
For linux/macos
```
REMOTE_HOST=pi@raspberrypi
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub |  ssh $REMOTE_HOST "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
> Update `REMOTE_HOST` to your `<user>@<remotehost>` such as `pi@192.168.86.24`

For windows
```
$env:RemoteHost="pi@raspberrypi"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh $env:RemoteHost "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
